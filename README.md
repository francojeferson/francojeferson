# Senior Frontend & Full Stack Developer

Iâ€™m a Frontend Developer specialized in Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript, committed to creating solutions that deliver tangible business value. My genetics journey revealed that my paternal lineage traces back to northern Europe, reflecting centuries of migrations and adaptations across the continent, while my maternal lineage originates from Central and West Africa, eventually extending to the Americas. Alongside my â€˜worrier-warriorâ€™ profile and a predisposition for myopia, I bring a broad, inclusive perspective to product development. By embracing TDD, agile methodologies, and a results-oriented mindset, I consistently craft accessible and innovative solutions that balance high performance with genuine real-world impact.
